### How it Works
* During each round, the GUI switches between each player to allow him/her to knock out a number off their scored. List of players can be inputted in ``` players.txt```

* The player is given 2 random numbers, and a 3rd number which is the sum of the first two. If the numbers are not available in the user's scorecard, his/her turn is skipped.
